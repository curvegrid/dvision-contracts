# Dvision Smart Contracts

This repository contains Dvision-related smart contracts. In the `contracts` folder is the BEP20 Dvision token smart contract, derived from the [Binance-provided BEP20 template](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc-genesis-contract/blob/master/contracts/bep20_template/BEP20Token.template).

The ChainBridge smart contract version used for the Dvision bridge is linked as a git submodule in the `chainbridge-solidity` folder.
